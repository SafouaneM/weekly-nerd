## Introduction to Svelte
Our last weekly nerd session was about having a structured workflow and the differences between a personal project flow and a corporate project flow. She told us that she was an old student from the CMD course. And that she wanted to give us a quick rundown on how things are done in the corporate world. The company’s she has developed web applications for are famous companies in the netherlands like MaxVerstappen, citizen, ajas, NLZiet, en Heineken. But most interestingly she talked about a new framework on the block called *Svelte* and it’s even newer counterpart *SvelteKit*.

## Svelte 
Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that focuses on creating efficient and performant web applications. It introduces a unique approach to building user interfaces by compiling components at build time instead of running them in the browser. This results in smaller bundle sizes and faster initial page loads compared to frameworks like React and Next.js.

Components in Svelte are reusable building blocks of a web application that consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic. They encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily composed and reused across different parts of an application. Svelte's component-based architecture promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, allowing developers to build complex UIs with ease.

Since its official announcement on April 13, 2021, SvelteKit has emerged as a promising new contender in the web development landscape. It aims to provide a comprehensive framework for building server-rendered applications with features such as routing, code-splitting, and prefetching. With its focus on performance and developer experience, SvelteKit has gained attention as a potential replacement for React and Next.js, offering a more streamlined and less bloated alternative for web development projects.

### Positives of Svelte:

- Efficiency: Svelte's compilation approach leads to smaller bundle sizes and faster initial page loads compared to frameworks like React or Angular. This optimization enhances the overall performance of web applications.
- Developer Experience: Svelte's syntax is concise and intuitive, making it easier to learn and work with. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability, modularity, and maintainability, allowing developers to build complex UIs more efficiently.
- Framework Size: Svelte is lightweight and has a small footprint. It requires fewer dependencies and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed, resulting in faster development cycles and improved project maintainability.

### Negatives of Svelte:

- Learning Curve: Despite its intuitive syntax, Svelte introduces a different paradigm and may require some adjustment for developers coming from traditional frameworks like React or Angular. This learning curve can be a challenge for newcomers to the Svelte ecosystem.
- Ecosystem Maturity: While Svelte is gaining popularity, its ecosystem is still growing and evolving. Compared to more established frameworks, the availability of third-party libraries, tools, and resources for Svelte might be relatively limited, requiring developers to be more self-reliant.
- Community Support: As a newer framework, Svelte may have a smaller community compared to frameworks like React or Vue.js. This could mean that finding answers to specific questions or troubleshooting issues may take longer, as there may be fewer community resources available.

## Svelte how to start?
