## Introduction to Svelte
Our last weekly nerd session was about having a structured workflow and the differences between a personal project flow and a corporate project flow. She told us that she was an old student from the CMD course. And that she wanted to give us a quick rundown on how things are done in the corporate world. The company’s she has developed web applications for are famous companies in the netherlands like MaxVerstappen, citizen, ajas, NLZiet, en Heineken. But most interestingly she talked about a new framework on the block called *Svelte* and it’s even newer counterpart *SvelteKit*.

### Svelte 
Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that focuses on creating efficient and performant web applications. It introduces a unique approach to building user interfaces by compiling components at build time instead of running them in the browser. This results in smaller bundle sizes and faster initial page loads compared to frameworks like React and Next.js.

Components in Svelte are reusable building blocks of a web application that consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic. They encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily composed and reused across different parts of an application. Svelte's component-based architecture promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, allowing developers to build complex UIs with ease.

Since its official announcement on April 13, 2021, SvelteKit has emerged as a promising new contender in the web development landscape. It aims to provide a comprehensive framework for building server-rendered applications with features such as routing, code-splitting, and prefetching. With its focus on performance and developer experience, SvelteKit has gained attention as a potential replacement for React and Next.js, offering a more streamlined and less bloated alternative for web development projects.
