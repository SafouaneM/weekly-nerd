# Susan from Campspace
Our very first weekly nerd was from Susan, who is a back-end developer in the company that runs Campspace. What started as a really interesting weekly nerd as she explained to us the importance of trying to understand how a back-end developer has to work with a front-end developer and likewise. However, I noticed that everything seemed cramped, and she was using Symfony. She also showcased some examples of filtering data using Elasticsearch, citing a server issue as the reason for using it instead of the usually reliable MySQL. Personally, I've worked with large amounts of data, and I believe it's more likely a server flaw than a problem with MySQL's performance.
I also observed that the class wasn't really paying attention, so I decided to ask her a question about why the company chose Symfony over a more robust framework called Laravel. Surprisingly, she responded by stating that Laravel is typically used for prototyping and "childish" projects, and it isn't widely used in production. I was taken aback by her response, but I didn't want to bore my classmates, so I chose not to engage in a discussion and simply accepted her statement. However, I would like to add that Laravel is the world's number one PHP framework for a reason, often referred to as "The PHP Framework for Web Artisans." While I acknowledge that Symfony is a powerful tool, it seems unfair to dismiss Laravel as suitable only for trivial projects. Both Symfony and Laravel can be used to build applications ranging from small to enterprise-level. So I thought how about a deeper dive into Symfony?
