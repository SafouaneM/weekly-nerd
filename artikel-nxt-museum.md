# Artikel NXT museum
Towards the last quarter of our minor, we visited the NXT museum in Amsterdam Noord. This museum was promoted as a 'Large-scale & immersive installations fusing technology & creativity with psychedelic light & sound.' So, when we entered, I expected quite an immersive experience. Following the assignment, I will write a short overview of my museum experience and then delve into the room I 'liked' the most, providing more details about it.

## The first room
The first room was actually quite immersive, my hopes got quite up after this room as we kind of could play with the lightbulbs and I could see myself move in the light bulbs.  I'll show you a picture and video of how that worked.

## Transition and Snapchat Room
So as I said my hopes got quite up after this room, I expected even more "immersive" experiences from the museum. Afterwards we met UFO which told us about some things that I did not really understand but it was meant as transistion to the next room. The only thing that interested me was that the screen and the animations were powered by Samsung. Afterwards we moved towards the snapchat AR room, I have no clue what this has to do with the minor. But I shot some nice pictures here with Jeffrey whilst we wore our best Lil Nas x / K'Sante cosplay dresses. Here's some pictures of him and us so you can compare.

Anyway, in this room, there were also glimpses of 3D-rendered women showing off their cleavages and engaging in movements that felt kinda sexually degrading towards women, which was kinda gross but I acknowledge that my perception may be subjective. There was also a big statue which represented clarity or something, it looked cool though I kinda liked the small details on the statue. We again had another transition which I tried to understand but again I did not understand a thing of what they were trying to say, from here I really felt that this experience was not for me.

## Gameroom

This room was really difficult for me to stay in. I really tried to understand what was going on, but the badly animated 3D CGI anime didn't really keep me hooked, especially when the card said it would take an hour to complete the anime. So I kept walking towards the controllers. There were four screens that had the video game associated with the anime running. We had the option to play the games or continue walking. Obviously, I wanted to try the game out, but unfortunately, the controls were so lackluster that I couldn't continue gaming. Also, if you even moved a single frame, the game would stop you to read some dialogue about the 'story'. But in my opinion, if you don't let the player immerse into the game world, it's kinda impossible to enjoy the story. I tried helping out my other classmates with the janky game controls, but they were done with it quite soon as well. Again, I think this is unfortunately not for me.

## Weird room
This room I completed quite quick, as there were just 2 dudes kissing on loop on the screen. Doesn't really make me feel comfortable so I continued to the next room.

## Foreign Nature
This room was actually quite cool, and it's one of the rooms that the museum promotes online a lot (although it lacks air conditioning, so it was getting really hot). I couldn't really grasp the connection with our minor, as this room was based on something called fractals. Using these fractals, Julius generated shapes and objects that intricately looped into each other, transitioning into new forms. I believe his intention was to display the vast beauty of the universe?

### Design analysis
After scanning the qr code I read that Julius used Mandelbulb3D to generate these beatifull shapes and landscapes, so behind all this art is a lot of math how fitting? What is kinda funny is that he calls himself more of a documentary maker than an artist. And he states "I use fractal formulas to reveal what already exists on nature's canvas". Which is true, as he enchances all the secrets and beauty of our universe. Especially the parts which looked like the life underwater were really cool to me.

## Conclusion
I think that you need a different kind of mindset if you want to connect with this museum, but it's certainly not for me, so I'm glad school paid for it and not me. The museum represents itself as an interactive experience, while that is not true, as you spend more time looking at vague things instead of doing things just as advertised. Anyway, as I said, the Foreign Nature room was quite cool, but if I have to be honest, that was not because of its meaning or something, but more because I was simply intrigued by its colors and shapes. And I still have no clue what kind of connection this has with our minor, but maybe other students have made the connection between the museum and the minor.
